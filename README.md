# 3-Hour Marathon Training Program - REVISED

**Goal:** Sub-2:50 (primary), Sub-2:58 (secondary)
**Target Race:** Napa Valley Marathon - March 1, 2026
**Training Start:** November 18, 2025
**Training Duration:** 15 weeks

## Training Resources

### Core Documents
1. **[training-plan.md](training-plan.md)** - Week-by-week training schedule (REVISED with Tuesday long runs)
2. **[workout-guide.md](workout-guide.md)** - Detailed workout types, paces, and execution tips
3. **[nutrition-guide.md](nutrition-guide.md)** - Daily nutrition, race fueling, and supplements
4. **[training-log.md](training-log.md)** - Track your actual workouts

### Your Training Constraints
- **Saturday max:** 6 miles (kids' activities)
- **Sunday max:** 13 miles (limited time)
- **Tuesday flexibility:** Up to 3 hours for long runs
- **Current base:** 40-50 miles/week
- **Strategy:** Tuesday long runs (18-22 miles) + Sunday quality runs for race adaptation

## REVISED Training Structure

### Key Change from Original Plan
The original plan had a 13-mile max long run. **The revised plan adds Tuesday long runs building to 20-22 miles**, which significantly improves your odds of hitting sub-2:50.

**New weekly structure:**
- **Tuesday** = Primary long run (builds to 22 miles)
- **Sunday** = Quality medium-long run (13 miles with marathon pace work)
- **Wednesday** = Quality workout (tempo/intervals - fitness driver)

This provides:
✅ Proper long run preparation for marathon distance
✅ Race-time adaptation (Sunday morning runs)
✅ Quality workouts for speed and threshold
✅ Higher peak mileage (72 mpw)

## Quick Reference

### Training Paces
- **Easy:** 7:30-8:00/mile
- **Marathon Pace:** 6:30-6:50/mile (race goal)
  - Sub-2:50: 6:30-6:40/mile
  - Sub-2:58: 6:45-6:50/mile
- **Tempo:** 6:25-6:45/mile
- **Intervals:**
  - 400m: 5:40-5:45/mile

- **Phase 2** (Weeks 5-8): 54-68 miles - Strength building
- **Phase 3** (Weeks 9-12): 56-72 miles - Peak training
- **Phase 4** (Weeks 13-15): 30-66 miles - Race prep & taper
- **Peak week:** 72 miles (Week 10)

## Long Run Progression

### Tuesday Long Runs
- **Weeks 1-2:** 12-14 miles (establishing base)
- **Week 3:** 16 miles
- **Weeks 5-6:** 16-18 miles
- **Week 7:** 20 miles (FIRST 20-MILER!)
- **Week 9:** 20 miles
- **Week 10:** 22 miles (LONGEST RUN - peak week)
- **Week 11:** 20 miles
- **Week 13:** 18 miles

**Total 20+ mile runs: 4 times** (3x 20-milers, 1x 22-miler)

### Sunday Quality Runs
- Consistently 10-13 miles with marathon pace segments
- Race-time adaptation (7:30 AM start)
- Practice fueling and pacing

## Current Week Status

**Week 0** (Nov 11-17) - Current/Transition Week
- ✅ 38 miles completed (as of Friday)
- ✅ Tempo session: 3.5mi @ 6:33, 1.5mi @ 6:10
- Plan this weekend: 6 mi Saturday (easy) + 13 mi Sunday (quality long run)

**Week 1 starts:** Monday, November 18, 2025

## How to Use This Program

1. **Review the training plan** each Sunday evening for the upcoming week
2. **Priority workouts (in order):**
   - Wednesday quality workouts (PRIMARY FITNESS DRIVER)
   - Tuesday long runs (marathon-specific endurance)
   - Sunday quality runs (race simulation)
3. **Recovery is critical:**
   - Fuel within 30 min after Tuesday long runs
   - Get 8+ hours sleep Tuesday nights
   - Keep Thursday truly easy
4. **Practice race-day fueling** on all Tuesday/Sunday runs 90+ minutes
5. **Track your training** in training-log.md

## Key Success Factors

### Do's
✅ Complete Wednesday quality workouts (top priority)
✅ Build Tuesday long runs progressively (don't skip steps)
✅ Practice fueling on all long runs (90+ min)
✅ Get adequate sleep, especially Tuesday nights
✅ Stay consistent with easy pace (7:30-8:00/mile)
✅ Take recovery weeks seriously (every 4th week)
✅ Fuel within 30 min post-workout

### Don'ts
❌ Skip Wednesday workouts
❌ Run easy days too hard
❌ Add extra miles beyond plan
❌ Try new foods on race day
❌ Neglect recovery and sleep
❌ Train through pain or injury
❌ Rush the Tuesday → Wednesday sequence

## Critical Training Notes

### Tuesday → Wednesday Sequence
This is a key back-to-back training stress:
- **Tuesday long run** depletes glycogen, stresses aerobic system
- **Wednesday workout** requires recovered legs for quality

**Recovery essentials:**
1. Fuel within 30 min of Tuesday run (30-40g protein, 60-100g carbs)
2. Hydrate aggressively Tuesday afternoon/evening
3. Get 8+ hours sleep Tuesday night
4. If legs are dead Wednesday, reduce workout intensity

### Thursday = Critical Recovery Day
- Keep truly easy (7:45-8:00/mile, no faster)
- This allows quality weekend runs
- Don't be a hero on recovery days

## Race Day Goals

**Primary Goal:** Sub-2:50 (6:30-6:40/mile average)
**Secondary Goal:** Sub-2:58 (6:45-6:50/mile average)
**Stretch Goal:** Sub-2:45 (if everything clicks)

### Realistic Odds (with revised plan)
- Sub-2:50: 60-70% probability
- Sub-2:58: 90-95% probability
- Sub-2:45: Possible with perfect execution

### Pacing Strategy
- **Miles 1-3:** 6:40-6:45 (controlled start, don't go out too fast)
- **Miles 4-20:** 6:30-6:40 (settle into goal pace rhythm)
- **Miles 21-26:** 6:25-6:35 (close strong if feeling good)

## About Napa Valley Marathon

- **Course:** Relatively flat, net downhill (fast course!)
- **Start Time:** Typically 7-9 AM (verify race details)
- **Weather:** Usually cool (50-60°F), ideal marathon conditions
- **Aid Stations:** Check what fuel they provide, practice with those products

## Why This Plan Works

**Original plan weakness:** 13-mile max long run meant race day would be nearly 2x longest training run

**Revised plan strength:**
1. **Proper long run preparation:** 3x 20-milers + 1x 22-miler
2. **Mental confidence:** You'll know you can handle the distance
3. **Physical adaptation:** Glycogen depletion training, muscular endurance
4. **Race-time adaptation:** Sunday morning runs simulate race start
5. **Quality midweek work:** Wednesday workouts build speed and threshold

This addresses the marathon-specific endurance gap while maintaining race-day simulation.

## Training Philosophy

This plan balances:
1. **Your time constraints** (weekend limitations, weekday flexibility)
2. **Your current fitness level** (40-50 mpw base, strong tempo work)
3. **Your ambitious goals** (sub-2:50 primary target)
4. **Evidence-based training principles** (long runs, quality work, recovery)

The focus is on **quality over quantity** with three key weekly workouts:
- **Tuesday:** Long aerobic development
- **Wednesday:** Speed/threshold work
- **Sunday:** Race-specific preparation

**Remember:** Marathon training is as much mental as physical. Trust the process, stay consistent, recover well, and believe in your ability to achieve this goal.
