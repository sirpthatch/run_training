Objective: Set a PR in a 3 hour marathon (under 2:58), with a stretch goal to
run under 2:50.

I would like to use this context/session as a training coash to help me achieve
this goal.  The training coach should help capture the training that I have 
done, suggest workouts that will help me achieve (or surpass) my goal, suggest
nutrition programs (including for during/after exercise), supplements, and any 
other activity that will help me achieve my goal.

This directory should also be used to organize relevatnt reference material
that will better equip me to understand the reasoning behind any training 
recommendation we make here.
