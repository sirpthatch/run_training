# Lower Back Recovery Protocol
**Date:** December 9, 2024
**Context:** Post 16-mile long run @ 7:21 pace - lower back pain, legs feel strong

---

## Today's Recovery Protocol

### **Morning (As Soon As Possible)**

**1. Gentle Movement (10-15 minutes)**
Don't stay completely still - light movement helps flush metabolites and reduce stiffness.

- **Walk:** 10-15 minutes easy pace
- **Gentle cycling:** Stationary bike, very light resistance, 10-15 min
- Purpose: Increase blood flow without load

**2. Heat Therapy**
- Hot shower focusing on lower back for 10-15 minutes
- OR heating pad on lower back, 20 minutes
- This relaxes tight muscles and increases circulation

---

### **Afternoon Stretching Routine (20-25 minutes)**

Do these stretches GENTLY - no forcing, hold each 30-60 seconds, repeat 2-3 times:

**A. Hip Flexor Stretch**
- Kneel on one knee (like proposing position)
- Push hips forward gently until you feel stretch in front of hip
- Keep core engaged
- **Why:** Tight hip flexors pull on lower back

**B. Piriformis/Glute Stretch (Figure 4)**
- Lie on back, cross one ankle over opposite knee
- Pull bottom leg toward chest
- Should feel stretch in glute/hip
- **Why:** Tight glutes refer pain to lower back

**C. Child's Pose**
- Kneel, sit back on heels, arms extended forward
- Hold for 60-90 seconds
- Focus on breathing into lower back
- **Why:** Gentle spinal decompression

**D. Cat-Cow Stretch**
- On hands and knees
- Arch back (cow), then round back (cat)
- 10-15 slow repetitions
- **Why:** Mobilizes entire spine

**E. Supine Spinal Twist**
- Lie on back, bring one knee across body
- Keep shoulders flat
- Breathe into the stretch
- **Why:** Releases lower back tension

**F. Hamstring Stretch (Gentle)**
- Lie on back, leg up against doorframe or use strap
- Keep knee slightly bent
- **Why:** Tight hamstrings stress lower back

**G. Cobra Stretch (Gentle Extension)**
- Lie face down, press up gently on hands
- Keep hips on ground
- Hold 20-30 seconds
- **Why:** Counteracts forward flexion from running

---

### **Evening Routine**

**1. Foam Rolling (15-20 minutes)**

Focus on areas that support the lower back:
- **Glutes:** Sit on roller, roll each side 60-90 seconds
- **Hip flexors:** Face down, roller on front of hip
- **IT bands:** Side lying, roll outer thigh
- **Calves:** Both legs, thorough rolling
- **Upper back/thoracic spine:** Roll mid-back (NOT lower back directly)

**Note:** Don't foam roll directly on lower back - can cause more inflammation. Roll around it instead.

**2. Lacrosse Ball Work**
- Glute trigger points: Lie on ball, find tender spots, hold 30-60 seconds
- Hip flexors: Stand, press ball into hip flexor against wall

**3. Ice or Heat? (Choose One)**
- **Heat:** If back feels tight/stiff (most common)
- **Ice:** If there's sharp pain or inflammation
- 15-20 minutes before bed

---

### **All Day Long**

**Hydration:**
- 100+ oz of water today
- Add electrolytes if possible
- Dehydration exacerbates muscle tightness

**Anti-inflammatory foods:**
- Omega-3s (salmon, walnuts, chia seeds)
- Tart cherry juice
- Turmeric/ginger tea
- Berries

**Nutrition:**
- 30-40g protein within 24 hours post-run
- Continue eating well today - recovery requires calories

**Sleep:**
- Aim for 8-9 hours tonight
- Sleep is when repair happens

**Posture:**
- Avoid sitting for long periods
- Get up and walk every 30-45 minutes
- When sitting, use lumbar support

---

## Core Activation (Optional - Late Afternoon)

If back feels better by afternoon, do GENTLE core work (NOT crunches):

- **Plank:** 3 x 30-45 seconds
- **Side plank:** 2 x 20-30 seconds each side
- **Bird dog:** 2 x 10 each side (slow, controlled)
- **Dead bug:** 2 x 10 each side
- **Glute bridges:** 2 x 15 reps

**Purpose:** Activate stabilizers without loading the spine

## Red Flags - When to Modify Tomorrow's Workout

**Proceed as planned if:**
- ✅ Back pain reduces 50%+ by end of today
- ✅ You can walk, sit, stand comfortably by evening
- ✅ Pain is muscular (dull ache), not sharp
- ✅ No numbness, tingling, or radiating pain down legs

**Modify tomorrow's workout if:**
- ⚠️ Pain is still sharp or severe
- ⚠️ Limited range of motion
- ⚠️ Pain when walking or standing
- ⚠️ Any neurological symptoms (numbness, tingling, weakness)

---

## Tomorrow's Workout Strategy

**Planned: 10 miles with 3x2mi @ 6:30 pace**

### If Back Feels 80-100% Better:
- **Warm up EXTRA thoroughly:** 15-20 minutes instead of 10
- Add dynamic stretching before workout
- Execute workout as planned
- Monitor back during mile repeats
- Abort if pain increases

### If Back Feels 50-80% Better:
- **Modify the workout:**
  - Keep the 10 miles
  - Change to 5-6 miles @ continuous tempo (6:35-6:45) instead of intervals
  - Less intensity, more sustainable form
  - Easier to bail out if needed

### If Back Feels <50% Better:
- **Skip the quality work:**
  - Run 6-8 miles easy ONLY
  - Focus on good form
  - Save the quality workout for next week
  - Better to lose one workout than risk injury

## Prevention Going Forward

**Pattern Observed:**
- Week 2 notes: "my back a little, nothing major"
- Week 4 notes: "knees and back hurt at mile 14"

**This suggests:**
1. **Form breakdown** when fatigued
2. **Core weakness** - can't maintain posture entire run
3. **Hip flexor tightness** - from high mileage
4. **Glute weakness** - compensating with lower back

**Long-term solutions:**
- **Daily core work:** 10-15 minutes, 4-5x per week
- **Pre-run dynamic warm-up:** Hip circles, leg swings, glute activation
- **Post-run stretching routine:** Especially hip flexors, glutes, hamstrings
- **Form check:** Video yourself at mile 15+ of next long run - look for:
  - Forward lean
  - Weak glutes causing lower back to overwork
  - Hip drop
  - Shortened stride when tired

## Bottom Line

The fact that your legs feel strong is a good sign - the back issue is likely muscular tightness, not a structural problem. Focus on mobility, hydration, and rest today. You should be ready for tomorrow's workout with appropriate modifications if needed.
