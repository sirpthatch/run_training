# Marathon Nutrition & Fueling Guide

## Daily Nutrition for Marathon Training

### Macronutrient Targets (Training Days)

**Carbohydrates: 5-7g per kg body weight**
- Primary fuel source for endurance running
- Focus on complex carbs: oats, rice, quinoa, sweet potatoes, whole grain bread
- Timing: Spread throughout day, emphasize around workouts

**Protein: 1.2-1.6g per kg body weight**
- Muscle repair and recovery
- Sources: Lean meats, fish, eggs, Greek yogurt, legumes, tofu
- Distribute across 4-5 meals for optimal absorption

**Fats: 20-30% of total calories**
- Hormone production, vitamin absorption
- Focus on healthy fats: nuts, avocado, olive oil, fatty fish
- Important for long, slow runs when fat oxidation is high

### Hydration

**Daily Baseline:**
- Minimum: Half your body weight in ounces (e.g., 160 lbs = 80 oz water)
- More on training days and hot weather
- Urine should be pale yellow

**Electrolytes:**
- Sodium: 3000-5000mg/day during heavy training
- Add salt to meals, consume electrolyte drinks
- Especially important in heat

## Workout-Specific Nutrition

### Pre-Run Fueling

**Easy Runs (< 60 minutes)**
- Can run fasted if preferred (morning runs)
- Or small snack: banana, toast with honey
- Hydration: 8-16 oz water

**Long Runs & Workouts (> 60 minutes)**
**2-3 hours before:**
- 300-500 calories
- High carb, moderate protein, low fat/fiber
- Examples:
  - Oatmeal with banana and honey
  - Toast with peanut butter and banana
  - Bagel with cream cheese
  - Rice with egg

**30-60 minutes before:**
- Small, easily digestible carbs if needed
- Banana, sports drink, energy gel
- 8-16 oz water or sports drink

### During-Run Fueling

**Runs < 60 minutes:**
- Water only
- No fuel needed

**Runs 60-90 minutes:**
- Water: 4-8 oz every 15-20 minutes
- Optional: 1 gel at 45-60 minutes

**Runs > 90 minutes (Long Runs, Marathon):**
**Carbohydrate intake: 30-60g per hour**

**Starting at 45-60 minutes, then every 30-45 minutes:**

**Hydration During Runs:**
- Water: 4-8 oz every 15-20 minutes
- Or sports drink with electrolytes
- Adjust for temperature and sweat rate

**Practice Schedule (for Sunday long runs):**
- Week 1-4: Get used to gels, try different brands
- Week 5-8: Settle on preferred gel/chew, practice timing
- Week 9-15: Perfect your race-day fueling strategy
- Use EXACT products you'll use on race day

### Post-Run Recovery

**Within 30 minutes (The "Golden Window"):**
**Target: 3:1 or 4:1 carb-to-protein ratio**

**Easy Runs:**
- Chocolate milk (16 oz)
- Banana + protein shake
- Greek yogurt with granola and berries

**Long Runs & Hard Workouts:**
- Recovery shake: 30-40g protein + 60-120g carbs
- Or meal:
  - Rice bowl with chicken and vegetables
  - Pasta with lean meat and sauce
  - Sweet potato with eggs and toast
  - Smoothie with banana, berries, protein powder, oats

**2-4 hours post-run:**
- Full meal with quality carbs, protein, and vegetables
- Rehydrate: 16-24 oz water per pound lost during run

## Race Day Fueling Strategy

### Week Before Race (Carb Loading)

**3 days before race:**
- Increase carbs to 8-10g per kg body weight
- Reduce fiber slightly to minimize GI issues
- Stay hydrated
- Example meals:
  - Breakfast: Pancakes with syrup, banana
  - Lunch: White rice with chicken, white bread
  - Dinner: Pasta with marinara, garlic bread
  - Snacks: Pretzels, sports drinks, rice cakes

### Race Morning

**3-4 hours before start (6:00-7:00 AM for 10:00 AM start):**
- 300-500 calorie meal
- Familiar foods (same as training long runs)
- High carb, low fiber, low fat
- Examples:
  - 2 slices white toast with honey + banana
  - Plain bagel with small amount peanut butter
  - Oatmeal made with water, honey, banana
- Coffee if that's your routine (don't change anything)
- 16-20 oz water

**30-60 minutes before start:**
- Optional: 1 gel or banana
- Sip water (8-12 oz)
- Use porta-potty

### During the Marathon

**Goal: 30-60g carbs per hour (for 2:50-2:58 finish)**

**Option 1: Gels (easier to carry)**
- Take 1 gel every 30-40 minutes
- Start at mile 5-6 (30-40 min in)
- Total: 5-6 gels for the race
- **Race plan:**
  - Mile 6: Gel #1
  - Mile 10: Gel #2
  - Mile 13: Gel #3
  - Mile 16: Gel #4
  - Mile 19: Gel #5
  - Mile 22: Gel #6 (optional, if needed)

**Option 2: Course Nutrition (check what Napa provides)**
- Rely on aid stations
- Practice with those exact products beforehand
- Typically every 2-3 miles

**Hydration:**
- Water at EVERY aid station (typically every 2 miles)
- 4-6 oz each time (2-3 big gulps)
- Don't skip any stations
- Take water with gels to aid absorption

**Electrolytes:**
- Sports drink every other aid station
- Or salt tabs/electrolyte capsules if needed
- Important for 2:50+ of running

### What NOT to Do

- Try new foods/gels on race day
- Skip breakfast
- Overhydrate (hyponatremia risk)
- Take too many gels (GI distress)
- Rely only on water (no fuel)
- Eat high fiber/fat the morning of

## Supplements for Marathon Training

### Recommended

**1. Electrolyte Supplement**
- When: During/after long runs, daily in heat
- Options: Nuun, LMNT, SaltStick caps
- Why: Replace sodium, potassium, magnesium lost in sweat

**2. Protein Powder**
- When: Post-workout recovery
- Type: Whey (fast-absorbing) or plant-based
- Why: Convenient way to hit protein targets

**3. Vitamin D**
- Dosage: 1000-2000 IU daily (if limited sun exposure)
- Why: Bone health, immune function, muscle recovery
- Test levels if possible

**4. Omega-3 (Fish Oil)**
- Dosage: 1-2g EPA/DHA daily
- Why: Anti-inflammatory, cardiovascular health
- Source: Fatty fish 2-3x/week or supplement

**5. Iron (if needed)**
- Get blood work: Ferritin should be > 50 ng/mL for runners
- Supplement only if deficient
- Take with vitamin C for better absorption
- Why: Oxygen transport, common deficiency in runners

**6. Magnesium**
- Dosage: 300-400mg daily
- Type: Magnesium glycinate (better absorbed)
- Timing: Before bed
- Why: Muscle function, sleep, recovery

### Optional Performance Aids

**Caffeine**
- Timing: 30-60 minutes before race or hard workout
- Dosage: 3-6mg per kg body weight (200-400mg for most)
- Sources: Coffee, caffeine gels, tablets
- Why: Improved performance, reduced perceived effort
- **Test during training workouts first**

**Beetroot Juice**
- Timing: 2-3 hours before workout/race
- Dosage: ~500ml or concentrated shot
- Why: Nitric oxide production, improved oxygen efficiency
- Effect: 1-3% performance improvement in some studies

**Beta-Alanine**
- Dosage: 3-6g daily (loading phase)
- Timing: Split into smaller doses throughout day
- Why: Buffer lactic acid, may help in later miles

## Key Principles

1. **Nothing new on race day** - Test everything in training
2. **Fuel early and often** - Don't wait until you're depleted
3. **Hydrate consistently** - Small amounts frequently
4. **Practice makes perfect** - Use long runs to dial in nutrition
5. **Individual variability** - What works for others may not work for you
6. **GI training** - Your gut can adapt to process more carbs
7. **Recovery is part of training** - Don't neglect post-run nutrition
