Muscle myopathy - "disease" in the muscles, making them weak
Ca2+ role in muscle operation - it acts as a signalling mechanism in muscle contraction.
   Essentially when a nerve cell is activated, the cell releases Ca2+ which frees up the 
   sites on the actin filaments that the mysosin binds to, causing a muscle contraction.  Prior to 
   there being a sufficient concentration of Ca2+, the protein tropomyosin blocks those sites.  The 
   mechanism is interesting - tropomyosin binds to the actin filaments, and troponin binds to the 
   tropomysosin.  When there is sufficient Ca2+ present, it binds to the troponin which changes the 
   shape of the tropomyosin.
sarcoplasmic reticulum - an organelle in muscle cells that store Ca2+ ions.  It releases them into the cell 
   when the cell is activated, and pumps Ca2+ back when the cell relaxes (SERCA pumps)

The whole process works different in smooth muscles - instead of binding to troponin and causing a
bio-mechanical force to open up the contraction binding sites, in smooth muscle Ca2+ binds to calmodium
which causes an enzyme (MLCK - myosin light chain kinase) to be activated, which phosphorylates the myosin which causes it to bind to actin and contract.  Myosin light chain phophatase (MLCP) pulls the Phosphate group off of the myosin, causing the muscles to relax.  The balance of MLCK and MLCP in the cell dictates how much it is contracting and how much signal it has to get in order to contract.
    - Why is there a difference betweeen how smooth muscle and skeletal muscle contracts?
        The skeletal muscle pathway is "designed" for rapid coordinated action in the cell, whereas the smooth muscle pathway is "designed" for slower, sustained contraction (e.g. used in digestion or in sizing the diameter of blood vessels)
    - Is the structure of myosin different in smooth muscle than skeletal muscle?   If you phosphorylate a mysosin filament in skeletal muscle, would it bind in the same way?
        MLCK is present in skeletal muscles, in a different isoform.  In skeletal muscles it is a "conditioner" or force enhancer on the troponin/tropomyosin pathway, causing a more forceful contraction 
    - What causes the smooth muscles to contract?  Does hte phosphate group release?
    - What makes the phosphate groups in smooth muscles?


Creatine Kinase is an important catalyst in muscle cells - it catalyzes the phosphroylation of ADP to be ATP, givinv the muscle the energy it needs to contract again.  It is the fastest way to replenish the reaction.  It does this by pulling a phosphate group from PCr and shoving it onto a spent ADP to make a fresh ATP and free Creatine in the cell.  Presence of Creatine kinase in the blood indicates that muscle fibers are damaged, leaking CK into the blood.

hepatic gluconeogenesis - process the liver does to generate glucose in the blood.  Liver does this to main blood cglucose homeostasis.  It kicks in after the liver depletes its glucose stores after fasting.  The process is complicated and energy intensive.  It relies on the presence of Glucose-6-phosphates (G6pase) to generate glucose.
    - Glucagon is released during fasting, and stimulates the production of G6pase
    - Insulin in released after a meal, and tells the liver to stop producing glucose
Effectively, if there is not enough glucose in the blood, then muscle cells cannot get the nutrients they need to recover

There is an intresting relation between liver and muscles role in clearing glycogen from the blood.  When we do a workout, cells signal that they are ready to suck in glucose from the blood (GLUT4), and when we eat glucose is stored in the muscles in a pathway that is independent of insulin.  The body wants to protect the liver's role in balancing the bloodstream's glycogen levels, so insulin acts as an inhibitor on the hepatic glycogensis  and a catalyst on muscles cells glucose uptake and glycogen conversion.
 - Exercise is important here because it is insulin independent - it can cause the skeletal muscles to pull glucose out of the blood, relieving stress on your liver (does not have to do glycogensis) and your pancrease (does not need to generate insulin)
 - Alcohol can muck with this process, it inhibit the cells ability to take in glycogen. But longer term it reverts.
