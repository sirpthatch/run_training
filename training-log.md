--- Overall I scaled way back this week, primarily because I was balancing time

**Week Notes:**
- Weather: Adjusted to the cold, but the snow on Sunday was enough to make roads slippery
- 16-miler - how did it feel? Felt strong but a little broken down at the end of the run.  Worried that I wouldnot recover over the week, but finished the week feeling a lot stronger than the start of the week.
- Fueling strategy working? Great, missed nutrition one day but otherwise stable and focusing on off the run nutrition.
- Wednesday intervals after 16-miler: Felt like 6:30 was too slow, so moved it up to 6:16 without too much trouble.
- Adjustments needed: Overally still conscerned that all of the pacing is too slow, but I am going to give it another week before making any adjustments.

## Week 8 (Jan 6-12) - REBUILD WEEK (Post-Travel)

**Total Mileage:** 53 miles (target: 50-54)

| Day | Planned | Actual | Notes |
|-----|---------|--------|-------|
| Mon (Jan 6) | Rest |9.5 miles, with 7 miles at 6:45 | First day back from travel - full rest |
| Tue | **12 miles easy @ 7:30-7:45 - LONG RUN** |rest | Start conservative, assess fitness |
| Wed | 8 mi w/ 6x400m @ 5:45 |9.3 miles at 7:00 pace | Short speed to reactivate legs |
| Thu | 6 miles easy 16 miles at 7:14|15.6 miles, 7:14 pace | Good long run, back at it |
| Fri | 6 miles easy |6.5 at 7:05 pace | Some miles at under 7 minutes a mile |
| Sat | 6 miles easy |0 | Rest day |
| Sun | 10 miles easy |12.3 miles at 8:00 pace | Assess readiness for Week 9's 18-miler |

**Week Notes:**
- How do you feel after travel period? Good, rested - my long distance fitness feels good, maybe lost a little on tmy tempo but not too much
- Energy levels back to normal? Yes
- Did the travel maintenance work? Did not do as much running as I intended, though I felt good about the running I was able to get done
- Ready for Week 9's 18-miler? Yes, I feel confident about it
- Also, I picked up a continuous glucose monitor, and have started to interpret the results.  On my latest long run, I started eating chews at 1hr, and again at 75 minutes.  The data shows that I had a pretty constant blood glucose level up until 1:45 minute mark, where it started to crash.  I think that suggests I should have continued to eat after 1 hr, and potentially more, to maintain my blood glucose.
