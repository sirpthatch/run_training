# Napa Valley Marathon Training Plan - REVISED
**Target Race:** Napa Valley Marathon - March 1, 2026
**Goal:** Sub-2:50 (primary), Sub-2:58 (conservative)
**Target Marathon Pace:** 6:30-6:50/mile
**Start Date:** November 18, 2025 (Week 1)
**Training Weeks:** 15 weeks + race week

## Constraints & Modifications
- **Saturday max:** 6 miles (family commitments)
- **Sunday max:** 13 miles (limited time)
- **Tuesday flexibility:** Up to 3 hours for long runs
- **Current base:** 40-50 mpw
- **Strategy:** Tuesday long runs (18-22 miles) + Sunday quality runs for race-time adaptation

## Training Philosophy

**Key Change from Original Plan:**
- **Tuesday = Primary long run** (builds to 20-22 miles for marathon-specific endurance)
- **Sunday = Quality medium-long run** (13 miles with marathon pace work + race-time adaptation)
- **Wednesday = Quality workout** (tempo, intervals, marathon pace - fitness driver)

This structure provides:
1. Proper long run preparation for the full marathon distance
2. Race-time adaptation (Sunday morning runs simulate race start)
3. Quality midweek workouts to build speed and threshold
4. Higher peak mileage (68-70 mpw) for better aerobic development

## Workout Timing Recommendations

### Weekday Schedule (Mon-Fri)
**Optimal timing: 1-2 PM start**
- Tuesday long runs: Start at 1 PM (allows full 3-hour window)
- Wednesday quality workouts: 1-2 PM start
- Easy runs: Flexible within 1-4 PM window
- Core body temperature elevated, properly fueled from lunch

**Tuesday Long Run Notes:**
- 18-mile run @ 7:30/mile = ~2:15 total
- 22-mile run @ 7:30/mile = ~2:45 total

### Weekend Schedule (Sat-Sun)
**Target: 7:30 AM start**
- **Critical for race-day adaptation** - Napa Valley starts 7-9 AM
- Saturday: Easy 6 miles (recovery from midweek training)
- Sunday: Quality 13-miler with marathon pace work
- **Extra warm-up:** Add 5 minutes in AM (muscles cooler)

### Weekly Timing Structure

## Critical Training Notes

### Recovery & Adaptation
**Tuesday → Wednesday is a key sequence:**
- Tuesday long run depletes glycogen and stresses aerobic system
- Wednesday workout requires proper recovery
- **Essential recovery practices:**
  - Fuel within 30 minutes of Tuesday long run (30-40g protein, 60-100g carbs)
  - Hydrate aggressively Tuesday afternoon/evening
  - 8+ hours sleep Tuesday night
  - Assess readiness Wednesday - if legs are dead, reduce workout intensity

**Thursday is critical recovery day:**
- Keep truly easy (7:45-8:00/mile, no faster)
- This allows weekend runs to be quality

### Long Run Fueling Practice
**Tuesday long runs 90+ minutes:**
- Practice exact race-day fueling
- Start fueling at 45-60 minutes
- 30-60g carbs per hour (1 gel every 30-40 min)
- Hydrate: 4-8 oz every 15-20 minutes

**Test different products weeks 1-6, commit to race-day nutrition weeks 7-15**

### Adjust for Life
**If you miss a workout:**
- Priority 1: Wednesday quality workouts
- Priority 2: Tuesday long runs
- Priority 3: Sunday quality runs
- Don't try to "make up" missed workouts

**If feeling overtrained:**
- Take extra rest day (replace Monday easy run with rest)
- Reduce Wednesday workout intensity
- Never skip recovery weeks

### Wednesday Workout Modifications
**After 20-22 mile Tuesday runs (Weeks 7, 9-11, 13):**
- Slightly reduce volume or intensity if needed
- Focus on quality over quantity
- Listen to your body - heavy legs mean reduce the workout

## Long Run Summary

**20+ Mile Runs:**
- Week 7: 20 miles
- Week 9: 20 miles
- Week 10: 22 miles (longest run, 2 weeks before peak week)
- Week 11: 20 miles
- Week 13: 18 miles

**This gives you 3x 20-milers and 1x 22-miler before race day** - excellent preparation for the marathon distance.

## Race Week Protocol

**Week 15 (Taper):**
- Significantly reduce volume (30 miles vs 66 previous week)
- Maintain some intensity with strides
- Prioritize sleep and nutrition
- Stay off your feet when possible
- Trust your training

## Expected Outcomes

With proper execution of this plan:
- **Primary goal: Sub-2:50** (60-70% probability)
- **Secondary goal: Sub-2:58** (90-95% probability)
- **Stretch goal: Sub-2:45** (possible if everything clicks)

The Tuesday long runs eliminate the primary weakness of the original plan. You'll be properly prepared for the full marathon distance with race-specific adaptations.
