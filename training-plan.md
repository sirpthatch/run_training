# Napa Valley Marathon Training Plan - TRAVEL ADJUSTED
**Target Race:** Napa Valley Marathon - March 1, 2026
**Goal:** Sub-2:58 (primary), Sub-2:50 (stretch)
**Target Marathon Pace:** 6:30-6:50/mile
**Start Date:** November 18, 2025 (Week 1)
**Training Weeks:** 15 weeks + race week
**Travel Period:** Dec 22-Jan 5 (Weeks 6-7 modified for maintenance)

## Constraints & Modifications
- **Saturday max:** 6 miles (family commitments)
- **Sunday max:** 13 miles (limited time)
- **Tuesday flexibility:** Up to 3 hours for long runs
- **Current base:** 40-50 mpw
- **Strategy:** Tuesday long runs (18-22 miles) + Sunday quality runs for race-time adaptation

## Training Philosophy

**Key Change from Original Plan:**
- **Tuesday = Primary long run** (builds to 20-22 miles for marathon-specific endurance)
- **Sunday = Quality medium-long run** (13 miles with marathon pace work + race-time adaptation)
- **Wednesday = Quality workout** (tempo, intervals, marathon pace - fitness driver)

This structure provides:
1. Proper long run preparation for the full marathon distance
2. Race-time adaptation (Sunday morning runs simulate race start)
3. Quality midweek workouts to build speed and threshold
4. Higher peak mileage (68-70 mpw) for better aerobic development

## Workout Timing Recommendations

### Weekday Schedule (Mon-Fri)
**Optimal timing: 1-2 PM start**
- Tuesday long runs: Start at 1 PM (allows full 3-hour window)
- Wednesday quality workouts: 1-2 PM start
- Easy runs: Flexible within 1-4 PM window
- Core body temperature elevated, properly fueled from lunch

**Tuesday Long Run Notes:**
- 18-mile run @ 7:30/mile = ~2:15 total
- 22-mile run @ 7:30/mile = ~2:45 total
- Start at 1 PM to finish comfortably before 4 PM

## Critical Training Notes

### Recovery & Adaptation
**Tuesday → Wednesday is a key sequence:**
- Tuesday long run depletes glycogen and stresses aerobic system
- Wednesday workout requires proper recovery
- **Essential recovery practices:**
  - Fuel within 30 minutes of Tuesday long run (30-40g protein, 60-100g carbs)
  - Hydrate aggressively Tuesday afternoon/evening
  - 8+ hours sleep Tuesday night
  - Assess readiness Wednesday - if legs are dead, reduce workout intensity

**Thursday is critical recovery day:**
- Keep truly easy (7:45-8:00/mile, no faster)
- This allows weekend runs to be quality

### Long Run Fueling Practice
**Tuesday long runs 90+ minutes:**
- Practice exact race-day fueling
- Start fueling at 45-60 minutes
- 30-60g carbs per hour (1 gel every 30-40 min)
- Hydrate: 4-8 oz every 15-20 minutes

**Test different products weeks 1-6, commit to race-day nutrition weeks 7-15**

### Adjust for Life
**If you miss a workout:**
- Priority 1: Wednesday quality workouts
- Priority 2: Tuesday long runs
- Priority 3: Sunday quality runs
- Don't try to "make up" missed workouts

**If feeling overtrained:**
- Take extra rest day (replace Monday easy run with rest)
- Reduce Wednesday workout intensity
- Never skip recovery weeks

### Wednesday Workout Modifications
**After 20-22 mile Tuesday runs (Weeks 7, 9-11, 13):**
- Slightly reduce volume or intensity if needed
- Focus on quality over quantity
- Listen to your body - heavy legs mean reduce the workout

## Long Run Summary (Travel-Adjusted)

**18+ Mile Runs:**
- Week 9 (Jan 13-19): 18 miles - first big long run post-travel
- Week 10 (Jan 20-26): 20 miles - FIRST 20-MILER
- Week 11 (Jan 27-Feb 2): 20 miles - PEAK WEEK, second 20-miler
- Week 13 (Feb 10-16): 20 miles (or 18) - third big long run
- Week 14 (Feb 17-23): 14 miles - taper begins

**This gives you 1x 18-miler and 2-3x 20-milers before race day** - adequate preparation for the marathon distance despite travel disruption.

## Race Week Protocol

**Week 15 (Taper):**
- Significantly reduce volume (30 miles vs 66 previous week)
- Maintain some intensity with strides
- Prioritize sleep and nutrition
- Stay off your feet when possible
- Trust your training

## Expected Outcomes (Travel-Adjusted Plan)

With proper execution of this plan:
- **Primary goal: Sub-2:58** (85-90% probability)
- **Stretch goal: Sub-2:50** (50-60% probability)
- **Reach goal: Sub-2:45** (20-30% probability)

**Impact of travel adjustment:**
- Lost ~80-90 miles during Weeks 6-7 (travel maintenance vs full training)
- Fewer total 20-mile runs (2-3 vs original 4)
- Still have 8 weeks of structured training post-travel
- Quality over quantity in final weeks will be critical

**Keys to success:**
1. Maintain 20-30 mpw during travel (Weeks 6-7)
2. Execute Week 9's 18-miler successfully (confirms fitness return)
3. Hit both 20-milers in Weeks 10-11 (peak phase)
4. Perfect execution of Sunday MP work (Weeks 9-13)
5. Protect easy days - no pace creep on recovery runs
