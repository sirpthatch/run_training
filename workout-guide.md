# Workout Types & Pacing Guide

## Training Paces for Sub-2:58 Marathon

### Based on Your Current Fitness
Your recent tempo session (3.5 miles @ 6:33, 1.5 miles @ 6:10) indicates you're in good shape for a sub-3:00 attempt.

### Pace Zones

**Zone 1 - Easy/Recovery (7:30-8:00/mile)**
- Purpose: Build aerobic base, active recovery
- Effort: Conversational, 65-75% max HR
- Usage: Most daily runs, recovery days

**Zone 4 - Tempo/Threshold (6:20-6:45/mile)**
- Purpose: Increase lactate threshold
- Effort: Hard but sustainable, 85-90% max HR
- Usage: Tempo runs, threshold intervals
- Breathing: Labored, few words at a time

**Zone 5 - VO2 Max/Intervals (5:40-6:10/mile)**

## Key Workout Types

### 1. Easy Runs
**Purpose:** Recovery and aerobic base building
- **Pace:** 7:30-8:00/mile
- **When:** Most daily runs, day after hard workouts
- **Tips:**
  - Should feel too easy
  - HR should stay below 75% max
  - If you can't hold a conversation, slow down

### 2. Long Runs
**Purpose:** Build endurance, practice fueling
- **Basic long run:** 13 miles easy (7:15-7:30/mile)
- **Progressive long run:** Start easy (7:30), finish at marathon pace (6:40-6:50)
- **Marathon pace long run:** Include 6-10 miles at goal race pace
- **Tips:**
  - Start conservatively
  - Practice race-day nutrition (gels/chews every 45-60 min)
  - Run on similar terrain to Napa Valley (flat to rolling)

### 3. Tempo Runs
**Purpose:** Increase lactate threshold - your ability to sustain hard efforts
- **Pace:** 6:25-6:45/mile (15-30 seconds faster than marathon pace)
- **Duration:** 4-8 miles at tempo
- **Structure:** 2 mile warm-up + tempo segment + 1-2 mile cool-down
- **Example workout:** 10 miles total w/ 6 miles @ 6:35/mile
- **Tips:**
  - Should feel "comfortably hard"
  - Focus on relaxed form
  - Even effort (don't start too fast)

### 4. Interval Workouts

#### 800m Repeats
- **Pace:** 6:00/mile (3:00 per 800m)
- **Recovery:** 400m jog (2-3 minutes)
- **Volume:** 6-8 repeats
- **Purpose:** Develop speed and running economy
- **Example:** 8 miles total w/ 6x800m @ 6:00, 400m jog

#### 1600m/Mile Repeats
- **Pace:** 6:10/mile
- **Recovery:** 600-800m jog (3-4 minutes)
- **Volume:** 4-5 repeats
- **Purpose:** VO2 max development
- **Example:** 11 miles total w/ 4x1 mile @ 6:10, 600m jog

#### 400m Repeats
- **Pace:** 5:40-5:45/mile (~85-86 seconds per 400m)
- **Recovery:** 400m jog (equal rest)
- **Volume:** 8-12 repeats
- **Purpose:** Neuromuscular power, speed
- **Example:** 8 miles total w/ 10x400m @ 5:45, 400m jog

### 5. Marathon Pace Runs
**Purpose:** Practice goal race pace, build race-specific endurance
- **Pace:** 6:30-6:50/mile (your target race pace)
- **Variations:**
  - **Sustained MP:** 8-12 miles continuous at marathon pace
  - **Long run with MP:** 13 miles w/ middle 6-10 @ MP
  - **MP intervals:** 2x4 miles or 3x3 miles @ MP with 1 mile jog recovery
- **Tips:**
  - Practice fueling during these runs
  - Focus on efficient form and relaxation
  - Learn what goal pace feels like

### 6. Strides
**Purpose:** Maintain leg turnover and running economy
- **Distance:** 80-100 meters
- **Pace:** Gradually accelerate to 90% effort (not a sprint)
- **Recovery:** Walk back to start
- **Volume:** 4-8 strides
- **When:** After easy runs 2-3x per week, during taper
- **Tips:**
  - Focus on good form
  - Relaxed, controlled acceleration
  - Not all-out effort

## Workout Execution Tips

### Warm-Up (Before Hard Workouts)
1. 10-15 minutes easy jogging
2. Dynamic stretches (leg swings, walking lunges)
3. 4-6 strides
4. Start workout feeling loose and ready

### Cool-Down (After Hard Workouts)
1. 10-15 minutes easy jogging
2. Static stretching (hold 30-60 seconds)
3. Focus on hips, quads, hamstrings, calves

### During Workouts
- **Pacing:** Don't start intervals too fast - even pacing is ideal
- **Recovery:** Jog, don't walk, during recovery intervals
- **Form:** Stay relaxed - tension wastes energy
- **Mental:** Break workouts into chunks (focus on current interval only)

## Adjusting Paces

### When to Run Faster
- Tailwind conditions
- Downhill segments
- Feeling exceptionally strong
- Racing shorter tune-up races

### When to Run Slower
- Hot/humid weather (add 10-30 sec/mile)
- Headwinds
- Feeling fatigued or sore
- Early in training cycle
- Recovery weeks

### Heat Adjustment Table
- 60-65°F: No adjustment
- 65-70°F: Add 5-10 sec/mile
- 70-75°F: Add 10-20 sec/mile
- 75-80°F: Add 20-30 sec/mile
- 80°F+: Add 30-60 sec/mile or move workout indoors

## Effort vs. Pace

**Remember:** Effort matters more than exact pace on any given day.
- Wind, temperature, fatigue, hydration all affect pace
- Some days, 7:00/mile feels easy; other days it feels hard
- Listen to your body and adjust accordingly
- Over time, your easy pace will naturally get faster

## Track Conversions (for 400m track)

- **800m:** 2 laps
- **1600m/1 mile:** 4 laps
- **5K:** 12.5 laps
- **10K:** 25 laps

**Target splits:**
- 400m @ 5:45 pace: 86 seconds
- 800m @ 6:00 pace: 3:00
- 1600m @ 6:10 pace: 6:10 (1:32-33 per lap)
- Marathon pace lap: 1:38-1:42 (6:30-6:50/mile)
